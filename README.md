# MTDAL
Multiple-model Time-sensitive Dynamic Active Learning For RGCN Model Extraction Attacks
TGCN file presents different types of recurrent graph convolutional networks.
ModelExtraction file simulate the MTDAL strategy on DBLP5 and DBLP3 datasets, and testing other strategies on Chickenpox and EngCovid datasets
